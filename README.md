# How to Use This Code

Install Flask:

pip3 install flask
```

Set up Flask to run in development environment:

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

Run the server:

```bash
flask run
```

You may get some errors at first, because the starter code is not complete. Don't worry; the errors are pointing you towards what needs to be done to run the project!

We have added TODOs throughout the code to further help you to complete the project. Good luck!
